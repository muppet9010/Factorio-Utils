- Add some ignores to the ignore rules list at the top of the file in the "IGNORE" variable:
	'542'		---  Ignores empty IF ELSE branches. I sometimes use them on complicated code to help readability.

- Add some data stage MOD globals to stds.factorio_data after the read_globals table:
		-- Muppet Utils - generic global object to store mod data in during unique data stages.
		globals = {
			'MODDATA',
			'MODDATAUPDATE',
			'MODDATAFINALEFIXES'
		}

- Add to the very end of the file the below so it doesn't object to Muppet Utils files:
		do -- Muppet Utils additions
			files['**/style-data.lua'].std = STD_DATA
		end
