---@class UtilityPlayerWeapon_RemovedWeaponToEnsureWeapon
---@field gunInventoryIndex uint @ The index in the gun and ammo inventory where the weapon was removed.
---@field weaponItemName? string|nil @ Nil if no weapon was in the slot.
---@field weaponFilterName? string|nil @ Nil if no weapon filter was set on the slot.
---@field ammoItemName? string|nil @ Nil if no ammo was in the slot.
---@field ammoFilterName? string|nil @ Nil if no ammo filter was set on the slot.
---@field beforeSelectedWeaponGunIndex uint @ The weapon slot that the player had selected before the weapon was removed.

--- Ensure the player has the specified weapon, clearing any weapon filters if needed. Includes options to ensure compatibility with a specific ammo type, otherwise will ensure the ammo slot setup allows the gun to be placed even if the ammo filter is incompatible.
