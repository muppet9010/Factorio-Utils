Yeah the settings are essentially volumes - see image
Left to right blocks are the moisture bands, desert, dirt, grass, wetland grass
top to bottom is temperature
left to right within a block is the aux value
the axis values are in prototypes/biome/biome-axes
and then the more specific assignments are in prototypes/biome/biome-spec
however
when you mix these values with tree noise the trees tend to bleed outside of their assigned volume, so it is only good for rough placement
so for example, sometimes you get my snow trees on non-snow terrain, but it is still cold there so for my purposes it is ok.
If you are aiming for something more specific then it would be better to use tile restrictions on the autoplace and build the allowed tiles list using my tile tags system.
The data phase alien_biomes object is defined in data.lua
it has the axes and specs tables but also the tile tags functions
alien_biomes.list_tiles(alien_biomes.require_tag(alien_biomes.all_tiles(), {"sand"})) for example would get you all dirt and sand tiles
alien_biomes.list_tiles(alien_biomes.require_tag(alien_biomes.require_tag(alien_biomes.all_tiles(), {"sand"}), {"red", "white"})) would get red and white sand tiles
the return value can be plugged straight into the entity.autoplace.tile_restriction
